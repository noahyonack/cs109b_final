    "# Final Project - Predicting Movie Genres!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Movie genre header](genre_header.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final project of CS109b. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall theme of the final project is movie data with a focus on movie genre prediction, because it is an area where we are all more or less application domain experts. First, you will explore your data and the challenges of the problem by exploratory data analysis. Use visualizations to find features that correlate with movie genres. These can be extracted from the movie posters, or meta data, or other data you gather, for example plot summaries or even movie transcripts. You will then compare traditional statistical or machine learning methods like generalized additive models, random forest, Bayesian prediction methods, boosting, and SVM, to deep learning models for movie genre prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project you will work in teams of 3-4 people and there are weekly milestones to guide you along the way. Even though the milestones are graded, they are mainly in place to make sure you stay in contact with your TF and make progress with the project. Throughout the project you also have room for creativity and to pursue your own ideas. While you need to hand in the milestones at the appropriate due date, there is nothing preventing you from working on a later milestone ahead of time. We suggest that you read through the whole project and all milestones in the beginning to be able to plan ahead. The project is pretty open-ended, so you can be creative and let your data science knowledge shine! \n",
    "\n",
    "For each milestone you will submit a notebook, in raw (`.ipynb`) and PDF formats, containing the deliverables of that week and the extra work you did so far. The notebooks need to contain your code, comments, explanations, thoughts, and visualizations. The final deliverables are a two-minute screencast, a report in paper style for a general data science audience, and all your data and code that you developed throughout the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a description of the data and the milestones with their due dates. All work is due by 11:59PM on the due date unless otherwise specified. We expect you to have the mandatory parts finished by the milestone due dates, and there will be no extensions. However, we strongly encourage you to plan ahead. For example, you need to think about the classification task early on to plan how you want to assemble your training data, and it is beneficial to start the deep learning work as early as possible. There is nothing hindering you to already train a model in the EDA phase to get a better feel for what challenges might lie ahead with the data. You should also see the milestone requirements as a basis for your own creativity, and we expect that most of you will go beyond the mandatory deliverables. For example, if you have a great idea about an interesting question that has to do with movie genre, but cannot be answered with the data from TMDb or IMDb, feel free to gather more data from somewhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a data interface in Python, because it is convenient for IMDb, and we will use Python for the deep learning part. Specifically we will use Keras, a deep learning library that provides a high level interface to Google's Tensorflow framework for deep learning. However, if you feel that you prefer to do some of the work, e.g., visualizations or data cleanup, in R then feel free to use it. You can also use Spark to preprocess your data, especially if you collect large amounts of it from other sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Important:* Your grade for a milestone will depend on the required deliverables you submit at the due date for that milestone. But every milestone, especially the final project submission, can contain additional cool work you did that goes beyond the deliverables spelled out below. \n"

    "### Movie Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is based on two different sources of movie data: [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) and [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). TMDb is great, because it provides the movie posters in addition to the metadata. This is crucial for the deep learning part, in which you will try to predict movie genres from posters. IMDb has more metadata available and will supplement the TMDb data you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "TMDb provides an easy to use [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) that allows you to download the data selectively. IMDb does not provide an API, but there is a Python interface available to access the metadata. We will use [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/), which is already installed on the AMI and virtual box images for your convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important*: Please remember to limit your data rate when obtaining the data. Play nicely and do not just spam servers as fast as you can. This will prevent your IP from getting banned. The easiest way to do this is to use the [sleep](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510348/how-can-i-make-a-time-delay-in-python) function in Python.\n"

    "### Milestone 1: Getting to know your data, due Wednesday, April 5, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning you should get acquainted with the data sources and do some EDA. Sign up for the TMDb [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), and try to download the poster of your favorite movie from within your notebook. Compare the genre entries of IMDb and TMDb for this movie and see if they are the same. Think about and write down some questions that you would like to answer in the following weeks. Keep the storytelling aspect of your final report in mind and do some pen and paper sketches about the visualizations you would like to produce. Include photographs of those sketches in your notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time a data scientist spends on a project is spent on cleaning the data. We are lucky that the data we have is already pretty clean. The Python interface to the IMDb ftp files does a lot of the additional work of cleaning as well. However, you will notice that the genre list for each movie from both databases can have different lengths. This needs to be changed in order to train a model to predict the movie genre. It is up to you to think about possible ways to address this problem and to implement one of them. There is no absolute right answer here. It depends on your interests and which questions you have in mind for the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you could also scrape additional data sources, such as Wikipedia, to obtain plot summaries. That data may give you additional useful features for genre classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "To guide your decision process, provide at least one visualization of how often genres are mentioned together in pairs. Your visualization should clearly show if a horror romance is more likely to occur in the data than a drama romance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook to submit for this milestone needs to at least include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- API code to access the genre and movie poster path of your favorite movie\n",
    "- Genre for this movie listed by TMDb and IMDb\n",
    "- A list of the 10 most popular movies of 2016 from TMDb and their genre obtained via the API\n",
    "- Comments on what challenges you see for predicting movie genre based on the data you have, and how to address them \n",
    "- Code to generate the movie genre pairs and a suitable visualization of the result\n",
    "- Additional visualization sketches and EDA with a focus on movie genres\n",
    "- A list of questions you could answer with this and related data. Get creative here!\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDA questions do not necessarily have to tie into the modeling part later on. Think freely about things that might be interesting, like which actors are very specific to a genre? Are action movies more prone to producing sequels than romances? However, as you keep the focus on movie genres, think also about correlations you might discover that can help build features from the metadata for prediction. Is the length of a movie title correlated with genre?\n"

    "1) There are differences in the genres listed by TMDb vs. IMDb\n",
    "    - We could use a union of the genres so that only those genres in both databases are considered correct\n",
    "    This also leads to a bigger question of \"What does it mean to correctly select a movie genre?\" Does thie mean that we select the best genre from IMDb, TMDb? Does this mean we might select multiple genres? These are all questions that we will need to face. \n",
    "2) The data will take a long time to load from the APIs because we need to restrict the rate at which we pull large amounts of data - ethics\n",
    "    - We need to work ahead and use AWS. In particular, if we are using a large dataset, we might need to pull a significant amount of our data in advance. \n",
    "3) We need to figure out what the \"Correct\" Genre means \n",
    "    - As we can see from the print out above, many movies have more than one genre. In this case we have that doctor strangelove is considered action, adventure, fantasy, AND science fiction. However, we probably want to create a model that only predicts one of these genres and not all of them. One way that we can break this down and make this easier is by creating a subset of genres that we believe exist in the world. (e.g. taking the top 50 genres.) Then for each of our movies, we make a prediction that only exists within that realm of genres. Another option is for us to try and predict all genres that might be attached to a movie, though this data might be too sparse to be predictive. "

The goal for this week is to prepare the data for the modeling phase of the project. You should end up with a typical data setup of training data X and data labels Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of X and Y depends on the ideas you had previously. In general though Y should involve the genre of a movie, and X the features you want to include to predict the genre. Remember from the lecture that more features does not necessarily equal better prediction performance. Use your application knowledge and the insight you gathered from your genre pair analysis and additional EDA to design Y. Do you want to include all genres? Are there genres that you assume to be easier to separate than others? Are there genres that could be grouped together? There is no one right answer here. We are looking for your insight, so be sure to describe your decision process in your notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for the deep learning part we strongly encourage you to have two sets of training data X, one with the metadata and one with the movie posters. Make sure to have a common key, like the movie ID, to be able to link the two sets together. Also be mindful of the data rate when you obtain the posters. Time your requests and choose which poster resolution you need. In most cases w500 should be sufficient, and probably a lower resolution will be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook to submit this week should at least include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discussion about the imbalanced nature of the data and how you want to address it**\n",
    "There is natural imabalance in our data because not every genre is represented in the same frequency on the TMDB 'discover' page. This is potentially because some genres (like action/adventure) are more popular with viewers and thus with producers than other genres (like documentaries). We discuss our choices in building our dataset with regard to this popularity imbalance in the following section. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We decided to perform a stratified sampling of our data because otherwise our poster dataframe would be too massive (700Gb). We want to downsize (scale) our dataset without changing the proportions of each of the genres in the original (large) dataset. To do this, we found the relative frequency of each movie genre in the entire dataset and then sampled according to these proportions. We ended up with a dataframe with 100 rows that has the same genre proportions as the big dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We chose 100 because some genres appear only 1% or 2% in the dataset, so using any size lower than 50 would mean that we wouldn't sample any of these genres, thus teaching our model not to predict these genres in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because of the imbalances we have in our data, we may want to explore combining some of the less-common genres such as Documentary and History into combined genres renamed as \"Informative\" for example (or Thriller and Horror into \"Scary\"). This will decrease the number of labels that we are predicting over and it makes our data less imbalanced by making sparse columns more populated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Description of your data **\n",
    "As shown in our summary table of the first 28 pages, adventure, action, and drama are the most represented within the database whereas documentary, western, and TV Movie are the least represented among sample, again, as shown in our summary table later in the notebook. Because the imbalance, we will need to take special precautions when sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is important to note that the 28 pages of TMDB movies are the most popular movies on TMDB as determined by the website's 'popularity' metric. While we found that the 'discover' function was the most convenient way we could quickly scrape together the data of many different movies, it seems worthwhile to note that this may exacerbate imbalances in our data. For example, if documentaries are by some measure less entertaining and thus less popular (as determined by TMDB) than \"mainstream\" movies like action-dramas, then our data aggregation technique would naturally have a lower representation of documentaries. In this case, genre proportion would be driven by the overall popularity of the genre instead of the overal number of documentaries created relative to other genres. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We don't believe that this is necessarily a bad thing for our data. It would simply mean that our universe of movies would be those that are most watched as opposed to those that are most made. This scheme has the added benefit that those movies that are more watched likely have fewer missing data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Furthermore, there is a technical constraint on shifting our universe to those that are most made. Because we believe (uncontroversially) that most movies are flops that few people have ever watched, we would need to scrape the movie data of a significantly higher number of movies in order to achieve a workable dataset. Furthremore, the 'discover' function in the API may not be enough, and we might need to slowly crawl through the alphabet to pick up those movies which don't appear on any of the pre-made pages by TMDB. While this may be an interesting problem to tackle, we think that the potential marginal benefit to this approach is not enough to greatly change the scope of the project. Thus, we will choose to continue to use a popularity-based approach. "

This means that when we make predictions, we will need to predict multiple lables (likely multiple bernoulli decisions, i.e. we will give a probability for all of the different genres. Because movie can have more than one genres, these selections are not mutually exclusive.) We will then predict the movie genres that are over 50% or we will take the top 2,3,4 or 5 genres as predictions. We might also take in our model the number of genres that the movie truly has.

In addition, we expanded our feature set beyond the suggested features by finding the director of each movie and the leading 3 actors. We did this by crawling  through the credits of each movie and then crawling through the list of cast members and crew members. We think that the leading actors and directors should give us improved predictive ability because most actors work on similar-type movies that would have similar genres, and many directors have specialties in movie production that would lead them to make more or less of certain genres (e.g. Michael Bay loves explosions - action). \n",

    "- **Next Steps** In the next milestone, we hope to incorporate priors into our models which indicate a priori prevalence of genre pairings. This is particularly important because when we are performing stratified sampling, we are using the genre proportions that are from only 28 pages of data. Thus, for more uncommon genres, there is high variance in simply applying a frequentist estimate of genre likelihood (e.g. the true proportion of documentaries could be 5% of movies, but in a sample of 500 movies it's very plausible that we could have only seen 10 documentaries (2% of sample).
