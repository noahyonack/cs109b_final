    "### Milestone 5: Final submission, report and screencast, due Wednesday, May 3, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "The grand finale! Gather all your experiences, ideas, results, and discussions into one coherent final report that tells a compelling story and produce a 2 minute screencast that summarizes it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your report needs to be max. 6 pages long (no more!) and include text and visualizations. Your audience are data scientists who did not spend any time pondering movie genre classification problems. Those data scientists do have the same background as you (e.g., you do not need to explain what PCA means) but they are not familiar with your data and the specific problems and questions you faced. Make sure to use good storytelling principles to write your reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "The screencast is for the same audience and needs to be max. 2 minutes long (no longer!). Do not just scroll through your notebook while talking--that is boring and confusing. You can extract visualizations from your notebook or produce new visuals and slides for a narrated presentation. Please use a good microphone and test the sound quality. Do not underestimate the time it takes to do a good job on your screencast. Start early, write a script, and collect additional materials that you might want to show. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Upload](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) your screenscast to YouTube.\n",

    "What to submit this week:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up to date versions of all your notebooks\n",
    "- README to go with the notebooks that explains how much the notebooks changed since the milestone submissions. This is to guide your TF to find the relevant updates\n",
    "- The 6 page final report as a PDF\n",
    "- The link to your 2 minute screencast on YouTube\n",
    "- A link to a .zip file with all your cleaned data\n",

    "#### Final Peer Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to provide positive feedback to people who truly worked hard for the good of the team and to also make suggestions to those you perceived not to be working as effectively on team tasks. We ask you to provide an honest assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. The feedback you provide should reflect your judgment of each team member’s:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preparation – were they prepared during team meetings?\n",
    "- Contribution – did they contribute productively to the team discussion and work?\n",
    "- Respect for others’ ideas – did they encourage others to contribute their ideas?\n",
    "- Flexibility – were they flexible when disagreements occurred?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your teammate’s assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall project score.\n",
