    "# Milestone 3: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods, due Wednesday, April 19, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you would address the genre prediction problem with traditional statistical or machine learning methods. This includes everything you learned about modeling in this course before the deep learning part. Implement your ideas and compare different classifiers. Report your results and discuss what challenges you faced and how you overcame them. What works and what does not? If there are parts that do not work as expected, make sure to discuss briefly what you think is the cause and how you would address this if you would have more time and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "You do not necessarily need to use the movie posters for this step, but even without a background in computer vision, there are very simple features you can extract from the posters to help guide a traditional machine learning model. Think about the PCA lecture for example, or how to use clustering to extract color information. In addition to considering the movie posters it would be worthwhile to have a look at the metadata that IMDb provides. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could use Spark and the [ML library](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#word2vec) to build your model features from the data. This may be especially beneficial if you use additional data, e.g., in text form.\n",

    "## Questions to answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach: Two Main Models: \n",
    "For our approach, we use two main models a random forest and a LASSO.  IN particular, we decided to focus on 10 main predictos about the movies (from who directed, the rating, and popularity) to an analysis of the textual response in the overview. However, before we could use our textual data for prediction we changed our textual response to become a count vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going from text to TFIDF\n",
    "For all of our models, we changed our overview to become a count vectorizer. A count vectorizer takes all of the words that from all of the different overviews and then makes a column for each unique word. Then we create a matrix called a document word matrix. This matrix holds the number of times each unique word is discovered in the document. We also got rid of any stop words that are common in the english language (e.g. \"the\" \"but\" \"and\" because we believed that these would not provide much information but would dominate our results.) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are we predicting exactly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are trying to predict movie genres. However, we have that each movie has multiple genres. This leads to the question of how we can predict multiple classifiers for the same object. This more general question is called a multilabel clasification problem. We will explore some of our specifications for this problem below. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best and most standard solution to do multilable classification is called \"one vs. rest\" classifiers. These classifiers create n models for each of the n labels. One of the advantages of this model is its interpretability and, for our cases, its ease. We can easily create a pipeline that then does these predictions for us. For an implementation of one vs. all, look at scikit learn: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html#sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "We will likely be using this in our early attempts at classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What does it means to be succesful? What is our metric for success?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*adapted from http://people.oregonstate.edu/~sorowerm/pdf/Qual-Multilabel-Shahed-CompleteVersion.pdf*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few options for our measure of accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exact Match Ratio\n",
    "The exact match ratio only considers a correct answer for our multilabel data if it is exactly correct (e.g. if there are three classes, we only classify this as correct if we correctly identify all three classes.) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy \n",
    "Accuracy is a simple way of \"goodness of prediction.\" It is defined as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i^{n}  \\frac{|Y_i\\cap Z_i|}{|Y_i \\cup Z_i|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $$Y_i\\cap Z_i $$ refers to the total number of correctly predicted labels over the total number of labels for that instance. So, if for example we predicted [romance, action]  and the true labels were [romance, comedy, horror], this would receive an accuracy of 1/4 because there was one correct prediction and 4 unique labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hamming Loss \n",
    "The final and most common form of error for multilable predictions is hamming loss. Hamming loss takes into account both the prediction error (an incorrect error is predicted) and the missing error (a relevant lable is NOT predicted.) this is defined as follows below \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{HammingLoss, HL} = \\frac{1}{kn} \\sum_{i}^{n} \\sum_l^k [l \\in  Z_i \\wedge l \\notin Y_i)  + I(l \\notin Z_i \\wedge  l \\in Y_i)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*For this project, we will use the hamming loss, which is defined above.* There is a convenient function in `sklearn` to calculate hamming loss: `sklearn.metrics.hamming_loss`\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is our first modeling approach? Why? \n",
    "Our first modeling approach was to use a random forest classifier use one vs all classifier. One VS all classifier essentially make a binary prediction for every one of the different genres. It predicts whether or not we should classify this movie within this genre or not. This allows us to make predictions for each of the individual genres. HOwever, it does suffer from the assumption that each of these genres are independent (we're essentially throwing away information with this assumption.) \n",
    "- What is our second modeling approach? Why? \n",
    "The second approach we used was a LASSO model. We chose a LASSO model becaue we knew that with our bag of words model we would have a significant number of predictors ~10,000. Unfortunatley, this could lead us to compltely overfitting in our model. One way of avoiding this is to use a model that regularizes. The LASSO, in particular, does a good job of this because it shrinks down our predictors to zero. We ultimately found, however, that this LASSO model did not do as well as our random forest \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our extension\n",
    "Beyond the basic unigram model, we also compared our model with other bag of n words. In this case, we find that our unigram model does slightly better than a bigram, trigram, or 4-gram model. "

    "## LASSO Predicting Poorly \n",
    "It appears that our LASSO continues to do a poor job of predictions even after using LDA to only use 100 of the features. This implies that the LASSO is not able to do enough regularization in order to make reasonable predictions in this smart matrix. This is also an indication that we should likely not use this model. Instead, for the remainder of this section, I will focus on how we might be able to improve our Random Forest model. "

    "# Extension: Using Different N-Gram for Prediction (Random Forest)\n",
    "One of the important extensions of using a n-gram model is that we are able to analyze more than individual words. IN a unigram model, we are making predictions purely from individual words and their respective counts. (e.g. \"The\", \"Hello\", \"War\", etc.) From there we make predictions about these movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible, however, that in only using a unigram approach we are losing information. Instead, we might want to analyze our data using more than one grame, likea bigram. An example of a bigram would be two words such as \"Not violent\",  \"Very much\" or \"no laughs.\" It's possible that using the second "

    "## Unigram with 10 Features Per Split Does Best \n",
    "It appears that our unigram model with 10 features per a split does the best (but only slightly). This might be because in our movie reviews we rarely have a contradicting statement within the summary (i.e. John is NOT in love with Kate\") or this movie is \"not scary.\" Instead, the simple word counts seems to do best in our model. The result is that we end up with a model with unigram features that does better than any of our other models. "

    "## Our Best Predictions\n",
    "Interestingly, our random forest unigram model does the best of any of our models (We're writing this from the very end, which is why we know this.) It predicts roughly 93% accurately which is roughly 8 points above the baseline. Our other models using neural networks and posters barely reach 86-87%. This indicates that either we are not giving enough data to our neural networks, neural networks do not always beat random forest in performance, or that movie posters provide less information than movie summaries.
