    "### Milestone 4: Deep learning, due Wednesday, April 26, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "For this milestone you will (finally) use deep learning to predict movie genres. You will train one small network from scratch on the posters only, and compare this one to a pre-trained network that you fine tune. [Here](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-use-pre-trained-models-in-keras) is a description of how to use pretrained models in Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try different architectures, initializations, parameter settings, optimization methods, etc. Be adventurous and explore deep learning! It can be fun to combine the features learned by the deep learning model with a SVM, or incorporate meta data into your deep learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Be mindful of the longer training times for deep models. Not only for training time, but also for the parameter tuning efforts. You need time to develop a feel for the different parameters and which settings work, which normalization you want to use, which model architecture you choose, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is great that we have GPUs via AWS to speed up the actual computation time, but you need to be mindful of your AWS credits. The GPU instances are not cheap and can accumulate costs rather quickly. Think about your model first and do some quick dry runs with a larger learning rate or large batch size on your local machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook to submit this week should at least include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete description of the deep network you trained from scratch, including parameter settings, performance, features learned, etc. \n",
    "- Complete description of the pre-trained network that you fine tuned, including parameter settings, performance, features learned, etc. \n",
    "- Discussion of the results, how much improvement you gained with fine tuning, etc. \n",
    "- Discussion of at least one additional exploratory idea you pursued"
